# ContractPlugin

## Introduction

This is the actual protoc-plugin executable that is to be built & distributed to clients (i.e protoc users).

## Build

Run build command to compile.
```
dotnet build
```

Though to build a single platform-specific binary executable you would need to use this command:
```
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx.13-arm64 --self-contained true
```

## Using with protoc

You'll need to locate the complete self-contained single binary.
```
cd <ProjectRoot>/src/ContractPlugin/bin/Release/net7.0/osx.13-arm64/publish
```

Then copy it to your /usr.. bin folder (i.e your PATH) so that the plugin is accessible via `protoc`
```
cp ContractPlugin /usr/local/bin/protoc-gen-contract_csharp_plugin
```

Now you can find a project with the required proto contract files and try it out.
```
protoc -I ./protos_test/aelf/ -I ./protos_test/ --plugin=contract_csharp_plugin --contract_csharp_plugin_out=. protos_test/hello_world_contract.proto
```

you can also try with a protoc-param e.g "stub" to get a different C# output.
```
protoc -I ./protos_test/aelf/ -I ./protos_test/ --plugin=contract_csharp_plugin --contract_csharp_plugin_out=. --contract_csharp_plugin_opt="stub" protos_test/hello_world_contract.proto
```

## Testing in AElf project

1. Complete `Build` step and run the following command to copy plugin to AElf project.
   ```
   cp <UserRoot>/contract_plugin-csharp/src/ContractPlugin/bin/Release/net7.0/osx.13-arm64/publish/ContractPlugin <UserRoot>/AElf/scripts/contract_csharp_plugin
   ```

2. Go to system contract module of AElf project, and run build command.

## Remarks

1. Since we change method type from `virtual` to `abstract`, and some methods were not implemented in some system contracts. It will probably build failed. Therefore I add a new flag so that we can generate abstract or virtual methods base on flag.
The usage is as followed.

   when run dotnet build command to compile it, use this parameter to decide generated method types.
   ```
   // for compile with virtual type
   dotnet publish /p:DefineConstants=VIRTUAL_METHOD

   // for compile with abstract type (default)
   dotnet publish
   ```
